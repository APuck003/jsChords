# TODO

- Ability to set a ChordRep to an instrument and validate it
- Ability to set positions and get back the chord name
- Refine the API (public/private functions)
- Support TABs at some point?
- Extend with renderers and support SVG (Raphael) and Canvas
- Better chord classification algorithm
- Left-handed diagrams and fretboards

# Contact the following ppl:

- Integrate with https://github.com/acspike/ChordJS 
- https://github.com/naiquevin/GuitarJs
- Include band.js to play chords and scales... (not that useful tho...)
